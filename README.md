# Math Honor Project

I will keep everything in this log. 
At the very beginning of the week I will list some TODOs, and try to move TODOs into DONE section. 
I will also list all the questions / problems in the HELP NEEDED section.

## Getting Started
The project require `python3.7+` and the installation of `jupyter notebook`.

To install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file, do
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Logs

### Jun 2 Meeting Questions and Todo

#### Question:
    - Trig polynomials form a basis?
    - Easy and well knwon transformation form poly to trig poly?

#### TODO:
    - Working rewrite?
    - Schedule meeting time during finals week

### Apr 15 - Apr 22


#### TODO
- Fixing the issues that are brought up in the Thursday meeting
- Finish writing the polynomial survey section
- Finish writing the SDP section.

#### DONE
- Met with Professor Dressler to discuss on the previous iteration of the writeup.



### Mar 8 - Mar 14

#### TODO
    

#### DONE
    - Created python scripts and generaeted results for unviarate cases.
    - Failed to optimize with ctypes, so the integration need time.
    - Jacobi Polynomial univariate
     

### Feb 22 - Mar 8

#### TODO
    - Jacobi Polynomial Basis
    - Optimizing the run time for integral by investigating the c_type of scipy

#### DONE
    - revise writeup (ready for review)

### Feb 8 – Feb 22

#### TODO

    - Picking up new polynomials
    - Optimizing the run time of bivariate cases

#### DONE
	- Coding:	
		- Lagrende poly uni & biv
		- Chebyshevs' bivariate for first kind and second kind
		- Run experiments for univariate monomial and two chebyshves
		- Run small degree experiments for bivariate monomial and cheby first kind and lagrende
		- See "python_code/univariate/" folder for pictures of univariate results.
        - Problem: the bivariate cases are very slow when doing the integration.
	- Reading:
		- Understood fomulation introduced in "Polynomial bases on the numerical solution of the multivariate discrete moment problem"
	- Writing:
        - Rewrote Introduction.
        - Rewrote everything.

#### Help Needed
	
	- Understanding of the Gergely Mádi-Nagy paper, is he correct?

### Feb 1 - Feb 8

#### TODO
	
	- Try understanding Chebychevs's basis via the source "Computing sum of squares decompositions with rational coefficients"
	- Read mathmatcial papers to become a better writer
	- (Next week) Revise writing

#### DONE

	- Implemented univariate chebyshve's basis
	- Performed numerical experiments between chebyshev and monomial
	- Found other sources. 

### Jan 25 - Feb 1

#### TODO

    - Understand multi-variate basis for Chebychevs's.

#### DONE

    - The writing for Preliminaries - Notations and Definitions sections is done. And it is ready for a review.
        - Note: I didn't proof read, so might be typos and misspellings and etc. 
    
    - Update python code to calculate coef moment matrix, and use that to perform compare coeff and form the linear system.

#### HELP NEEDED

    - Same as last week


### Jan 18 - 25

#### TODO

    - Update the write up to cover the main idea in the master Thesis
        - Coefficients Moment Matrix
    - Update python code to calculate coeff moment matrix, and use that to perform compare coeff and form the linear system.

#### DONE

    - Update the write up
        - Definitions that we need for linear algebra operations
        - Write till Moment matrix

#### HELP NEEDED

    - Citing new sources doesnt seem to work? 
    - More accessible sources to understand polynomial basis
    - Some feedbacks on the current write up?

## Long Term Goals

    - Bivarate case
    - Understand Polynomial Basis in multivariate cases (at least know how to generate them)
         - Bessel
         - Chebychevs's 
         - ...
