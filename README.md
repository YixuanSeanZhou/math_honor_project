# Math Honor Project

I will keep everything in this log. 
At the very begining of the week I will list some TODOs, and try to move TODOs into DONE section. 
I will also list all the questions / problems in the HELP NEEDED section.

## Logs

### Feb 1 - Feb 8

#### TODO
	
	- Try understanding Chebychevs's basis via the source "Computing sum of squares decompositions with rational coefficients"
	- Read mathmatcial papers to become a better writer
	- (Next week) Revise writing

### Jan 25 - Feb 1

#### TODO

    - Understand multi-variate basis for Chebychevs's.

#### DONE

    - The writing for Preliminaries - Notations and Definiations sections is done. And it is ready for a review.
        - Note: I didn't proof read, so might be typos and misspellings and etc. 
    
    - Update python code to calculate coef moment matrix, and use that to perform compare coeff and form the linear system.

#### HELP NEEDED

    - Same as last week


### Jan 18 - 25

#### TODO

    - Update the write up to cover the main idea in the master Thesis
        - Coefficiet Moment Matrix
    - Update python code to calculate coef moment matrix, and use that to perform compare coeff and form the linear system.

#### DONE

    - Update the write up
        - Definiations that we need for linear algebra operations
        - Write till Moment matrix

#### HELP NEEDED

    - Citing new sources doesnt seem to work? 
    - More accessible sources to understand polynomial basis
    - Some feedbacks on the current write up?

## Long Term Goals

    - Bivarate case
    - Understand Polynomial Basis in multivariate cases (at least know how to generate them)
         - Bessel
         - Chebychevs's 
         - ...
