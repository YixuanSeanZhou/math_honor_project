  journal={Annals of Operations Research},

month={Nov},

volume={200},
number={1},
pages={75-92},
abstract={The multivariate discrete moment problem (MDMP) has been introduced by Pr{\'e}kopa. The objective of the MDMP is to find the minimum and/or maximum of the expected value of a function of a random vector with a discrete finite support where the probability distribution is unknown, but some of the moments are given. The MDMP can be formulated as a linear programming problem, however, the coefficient matrix is very ill-conditioned. Hence, the LP problem usually cannot be solved in a regular way. In the univariate case Pr{\'e}kopa developed a numerically stable dual method for the solution. It is based on the knowledge of all dual feasible bases under some conditions on the objective function. In the multidimensional case the recent results are also about the dual feasible basis structures. Unfortunately, at higher dimensions, the whole structure has not been found under any circumstances. This means that a dual method, similar to Pr{\'e}kopa's, cannot be developed. Only bounds on the objective function value are given, which can be far from the optimum. This paper introduces a different approach to treat the numerical difficulties. The method is based on multivariate polynomial bases. Our algorithm, in most cases, yields the optimum of the MDMP without any assumption on the objective function. The efficiency of the method is tested on several numerical examples.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid FOREX predictor model is developed by using a recurrent Legendre polynomial neural network (RLPNN) with an improved shuffled frog leaping (ISFL) based learning strategy. The recurrent network used in this study is a high order single layer neural network, structured using Legendre polynomials with feedback paths. The new recurrent network assembled integrating a functional expansion block with a delay block helps to map the internal nonlinearity associated with the input and output samples. Further a nature inspired learning strategy based on the memetic evolution of a team of frogs in search of their food locations is set forth to estimate the unrevealed parameters of the network. Empirically the model validation is realized over three currency exchange data sets accumulated within same period of time. Result investigation clearly illustrates the higher predictability of the proposed model compared to other models included in the study.}

abstract={This paper develops a Legendre neural network method (LNN) for solving linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), system of ordinary differential equations (SODEs), as well as classic Emden--Fowler equations. The Legendre polynomial is chosen as a basis function of hidden neurons. A single hidden layer Legendre neural network is used to eliminate the hidden layer by expanding the input pattern using Legendre polynomials. The improved extreme learning machine (IELM) algorithm is used for network weights training when solving algebraic equation systems, and several algorithm steps are summed up. Convergence was analyzed theoretically to support the proposed method. In order to demonstrate the performance of the method, various testing problems are solved by the proposed approach. A comparative study with other approaches such as conventional methods and latest research work reported in the literature are described in detail to validate the superiority of the method. Experimental results show that the proposed Legendre network with IELM algorithm requires fewer neurons to outperform the numerical algorithm in the latest literature in terms of accuracy and execution time.},
